# Severstal Steel Defect Detection 

severstal_final_test_preds_0111_3.csv is our best submission

src/*.ipynb are our training and testing code, and should be run
on Codelab

Dataset should be put on Google Drive in:
Colab Notebooks/severstal-steel-defect-detection.zip

We also made a local-runnable version of inference - 
inference.py, with env.yml being the conda file,
but there is some issues depending on machine (tensorflow sucks),
so please use Codelab to run the notebooks first 

To use inference.py, put dataset under input/

models are in models/ 
It requires git-lfs to download them
